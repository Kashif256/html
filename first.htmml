        <p <h3> ABOUT ME </h3>:<br>
            This is Kashif Ulhaq K, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering (pre-final year) at C. Abdul Hakeem College of Engineering and Technology. I am currently working as a Software Developer Intern at LarkLabs.ai. Previously, I worked as a Quality Assurance Tester Intern at Pioneersoft, where I gained strong knowledge in software testing.
            Beyond academics, I enjoy reading books with emotional endings. The first book I started reading was "Can We Be Strangers Again?"</p>
